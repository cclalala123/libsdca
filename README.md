# libsdca

libsdca is a library for multiclass classification based on stochastic dual coordinate ascent (SDCA).

Features:
- Matlab interface
- Top-k Multiclass SVM
- Multiclass SVM of Crammer and Singer
- Proximal operators including efficient projections onto the unit simplex and the top-k simplex

The library is currently in active development and more features are planned.

## Installation instructions

libsdca can be installed on Linux and OS X in two ways.

- Using a make script in Matlab:
```
run matlab/make.m
```

- Using CMake (requires [CMake](https://cmake.org) version >= 2.8.9):
```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make install -j2
```

Once libsdca is compiled, add the corresponding directory to the Matlab search path:
```
addpath matlab
```

## Quick start

The Matlab interface is installed to the directory `matlab`, which should contain two mex files:

- `libsdca_prox` provides proximal operators;
- `libsdca_solve` provides solvers for multiclass classification.

To train the Multiclass SVM of Crammer and Singer on some random data, run
```
model = libsdca_solve(randn(2,15),randi(3,15,1))
```

To check the top-k training accuracies, see
```
model.evals(end).accuracy
```

To train the Top-k Multiclass SVM, specify the corresponding objective and the k
```
model = libsdca_solve(randn(2,15),randi(3,15,1),struct('objective','topk_svm','k',2))
```

Type `libsdca_prox('help')` and `libsdca_solve('help')` for further information.
